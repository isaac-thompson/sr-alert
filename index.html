      <h2>How to announce an element using  role = "alert"</h2>
      <p>If an element already has role="alert" and is initially hidden using CSS, making it visible will cause the
        alert
        to fire as if it was just added to the page. This means that an existing alert can be "reused" multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: In some cases users of older assistive technology may still be able to perceive the alert text even
        if the alert does not currently apply, causing users to incorrectly believe that there is a problem.

      <h3>What is accessibility</h3>
      <p>Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y—as in "a" then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means
        enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some
        way.
        For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, technology makes things possible.
        Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible no matter an individual's physical and
        cognitive abilities and no matter how they access the web.

      <h3>ERROR</h3>
      <p>
        This div simulates an error message to the user after entering a wrong number in the search box.
        <br>This page is a static html document containing an error message hidden by CSS.
        The error message is not visible until the page has been reloaded.
        <br>Using role="alert" the content of this div will be read before all
        other content after reloading...
        <br>This content is semantically located in a div at the bottom of the page but
        a modern screen reader will recognize this is an alert and read it first!
